# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `goethe` command (`serve`, `list`, `doctor`), standard library only, with an installer. See `docs/cli.md`.
- `goethe connect` runs a coding agent against the server for one command.
- `nvfp4-kernels/`: patched NInfer tile for the down projection and a draft-shortlist patch for the model file, applied by `install.sh` and `fetch_model.sh` (about 5 % faster decode).
- Passive lineup README; serve via [`examples/`](examples/) (ternary + Flash-Next NVFP4).
- SGLang patch: skip ternary for DSpark/NEXTN draft stages and mismatched expert counts.
- Current Hub ids in docs and examples.

## 0.1.0

- `ternary_runtime` and MoE ternary packs on Hugging Face.
- `nvfp4-kernels/`: pinned NInfer, Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 fetch and benchmark on one RTX 5090.
